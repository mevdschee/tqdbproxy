Key Insights:
=============

1. Delay Range: 3.12 ms to 28.71 ms
   - Lower delays at lower throughput (more responsive)
   - Higher delays at higher throughput (more batching)

2. Adaptive Behavior:
   - System automatically adjusts delay based on load
   - Balances latency vs batching efficiency
   - Responds to changes in real-time

3. Recommendations:
   - Low load (1.0k ops/s): Use min delay ~3ms for responsiveness
   - Low load (10.0k ops/s): Use min delay ~26ms for responsiveness
   - High load (100.0k ops/s): Use max delay ~24ms for throughput
   - High load (1.0M ops/s): Use max delay ~29ms for throughput
